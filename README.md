**How it works**
You will be given a total of ten questions in order to determine if you are more of a cyberpunk or a solarpunk.
Each question is given with two choices that you can answer by clicking on one of the two answers.
Clicking on your answer will display the total amount of votes people have made for each answer on that question.
